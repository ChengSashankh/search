The search project I've always wanted to work on. 

Deeno is a search engine project that I am just beginning to undertake. The goal of this project is to really just 
understand what it takes to build search - so I'm building everything from the UI, the microservices and the data 
pipelines from scratch.

When complete, I picture search functionality on the entire Wikipedia dataset powered by microservices and Spark jobs
written from scratch. 

This project is built to have three components:

1. Web interface built with Angular 15.
2. Microservices built with the Spring framework. 
3. Indexers built using Apache Spark that update a Redis cluster.

I work on this when I have time off classes and work, so it can get quiet here at times, but its one step at a time.

The plan:
1. Deploy and get a simple inverted index based retrieval system on the cloud.
2. Graduate to ranked retrieval.
3. Move to vector space retrieval using deep learning representations.
4. Integrate question answering ability using language models.

I'm at step 1 now, and once the infrastructure is up and running, things should really accelerate. Stay tuned!
